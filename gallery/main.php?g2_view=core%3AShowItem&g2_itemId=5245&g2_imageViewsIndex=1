To quote Bob Dylan, from his song, &quot;Like a Rolling Stone,&quot; 'When you ain't got nuthin', you got nuthin' to lose/ You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.' Which can make a formerly nice enough girl become dangerous, willing to unzip it, become a Truthteller. In art school one of the first things our teachers told us about the artworld was, no matter what happens, suck it up and swallow it, or you will be blacklisted. Interesting that was the expression I heard from men (for the most part) who had survived the repressive miasma of fifties McCarthyistic witch hunts. Witness the background color on this website: Fifties Green it was called. Shudder. But it's appropo to the decade I was born in, so I like it for my art. One of the first times I can remember being beyond embarrassment (danger!), willing to embarrass onother in public (danger! danger!) was in a crowded hallway of art revelers outside the Wirtz Gallery at 49 Geary in San Francisco, waiting to get on a crowded elevator. Just as the door opened, I caught sight of Jeff Nathanson in the far corner of the elevator. As we squeezed into the elevator I greeted him loudly, as though he were an old friend, I called him by name, said how glad I was to see him. A simple act on my part, yet I saw him blanche white, then burn red, as all eyes were upon him. What, you may wonder, prompted such an aggressive act on my part? Well, have a seat and I shall tell. Jeff Nathanson directed the Richmond Art Center, when I was approached by the Curator, Candice Farlice to make an Installation for the upcomming 500 year aniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus, and ensuing colonialization, along with the havoc, chaos, devastation and ruin wreaked on the people and nature of the Americas. Various artists and artist groups were invited to create for the show which would be exhibited the following year, titled: History, Truth or Consequences. Sure, I told Candice, right up my alley. The exhibition would showcase various atrocities throughout history relating to colonialization. When I told Candice I wished to install on the subject of the Holocaust, as my people are Jewish, I was informed the Holocaust was covered by another artist, Lisa Kokin. As I recently had been studying the witch-burnings of the Inquisition, and my people are women, ( The Spanish took the ball of the siezing of property, the imprisonment, the torture, and various methods of murdering, most noticably burning at the stake happening all over Europe, and ran with it.) Effecting many more women accused of witch-craft, though &quot;heretics&quot; of all kinds  were targeted, the atrocities lasted well over 300 years, eventually ended here in th U.S., back in Salem, MA. I suggested that as subject, and the idea met with approval from the Curator. Woo-hooo! I was on my way. Over the course of the next year drawings, plans, and sculptures in progress were examined and approved by the Curator, who presumably was consulting with the Director, each step of the way. After this year of planning, researching, and writing (for the wall text), all work was trucked from my studio in East Oakland to The Richmond Art Center. I installed diligently for two days, with a plan to document on the third day, the day before the Opening. The artwork which consisted of seven sculptures, several black painted industrial structures, a few large bags of potting soil, and about one-thousand burnt wooden matches, went up, like a lifeboat rising up out of a shipwrecked ocean. Candace loved my work, she had given me the prized center of the huge exhibition space. Everything was contained in a crystallization of the moment in history combined with my own torment as a child, a woman, an artist, a person in this world. I was thrilled. Candace was thrilled. I returned home in triumph to relax after the hurculean effort it took to pull it off. At home that evening, the phone rang. It was Candace. Jeff The Director didn't like it, didn't want it, wanted it dismantled. She sounded horrified and embarrassed. She, who was also being overridden, couldn't explain it, she mumbled awkwardly about it &quot;being too powerful for him.&quot; Two women burnt by a man, all these centuries later, the honor and homage I tried to do the suffering women of so long ago, bled through the centuries. Through the nauseated knowlege there was nothing to be done, I said I would be there as planned to photogragh the work done, then we could discuss how to re-present the work in a way that might satisfy the Little Lord Inquisitor. She agreed. I did not hear from her the next morning. Luckily a friend brought me there, was there to catch my crashing spirit on arrival to realize  the entire thing had been dismantled before I could document. Three sculptures were neatly placed on white pedestals, a tiny bit of soil sprinkled evenly on each; all sanitized, watered down to the satisfaction of Jeff Nathanson the Director. Candace the Curator was there and I doubt I will ever encounter a face so chagrined as hers was, when she greeted Chandra the Artist. I feel I let the Curator off easy, I think, when I encountered him at the elevator at 49 Geary, several weeks later.

In 1991 I was invited by a curator at the Jewish Museum in San Francisco, name unremembered to hang work in 'Mask Invitational.' A very nice experience it was, I told the museum of several multi-culti friends who likewise did work that would fit in, they too were invited, a celebration of Purim, good food, a good time was had by all. Two years later, 1993, a new curator (name unremembered) invited me, and some of the old friends, including my Vietnamese boyfriend at the time, included both years, to all join in the multi-culti Purim festivities again at the museum. The show this time was called 'About Face', ironically enough. We all brought our work over to be installed, mine was in a prominently appropriate placement in the exhibit. Two to three nights before the opening I recieved a phone call from the curator. Well, she told me, best to come pick up your work before the opening (two pieces), it shan't be included after all. Not even a mumbled word of explanation, this time. I will admit my heart was broken. I told all my friends who had been included (most of them on my recomendation) and met with somewhat sympathetic silence. My boyfriend to his everlasting credit, got on the phone immediately the very next day, to tell the museum that unless they showed my work as promised, he would be removing his work from the exhibition as well. Daunted they were by this rare showing of solidarity. They relented. Trepidatious, I entered the night of the opening, boyfriend in his proud moment on my arm, entourage sheepishly trailing behind. my work was nowhere to be seen! I guzzled some champaigne, went in search, found it at last. My work had been relegated to the basement with the children's artwork, where the children were enjoying their own bemasked, becostumed Purim celebration, playing their child games. Well. Still young enough in those days to suck it up and swallow it, I philisophically and joyfully joined the children---with whom I have always gotten along very well---in thier games.

Well, maybe the word 'revenge' is a little, shall we say, strong. This corner will include several motives under the umbrella word in the title. The following goes more under the heading of expose and apology. After you are done at this website go to wikipedia.com and type Congressman Andrew J. May into the search box, or google May+Garsson. At Wikipedia article scroll down to Munitions Scandal, and articles sited below in biblio. It is an article about perhaps the first war profiteering scandal publicized across the nation. It is about my Grandfather, Murray Garsson, my granduncle, Henry Garsson, and my father Joseph Garsson in relation to Congressman May. It is about a large-scale scamming of the American Taxpayer and the U.S. government to the tune of millions of dollars. Even worse, it gave birth to an entire system of war and monkey business as usual, from Contragate to Blackwatergate non-construction in Iraq, with billions at stake these days. These people, my relatives, may as well have written the book &quot;How to Bilk the Government Out of Billions, for Dummies.&quot; My father, then in his twenties was kept out of the army during WWII so that he could work for these three crooks. All were eventually indicted and tried and convicted, with the exception of my father. An expert skier, he was instead recruited into the Ski Brigade, utilized for various purposes to cross the Alps from Switzerland into Italy. Better a war hero, however unwilling, than to go to jail. Bully for him, it's about the only heroic act of his life. Worse than the millions, they were at least in part responsible for the malfunctioning of defective fuses manufactured under their less than watchful eyes, the resultant explosian killed thirty-eight American soldiers. My writing of this here is not about revenge, as my father died last year, he cannot know I've written this. What this is about is my sincere wish, however belatedly, knowing I am in no way responsible, I was not born at the time, to say: I'm sorry. I apologize to the spirits of the soldiers who died, I apologize to their families, their friends, and to the American people, and the government at the time. Like I said, I wasn't to be born for many years to come, it is said in Judeo Christian society that the sins of the fathers shall not be visited upon the children. But they are, aren't they? When we know what happened, when we are enough in touch with our human feelings to know how we feel, when we are people of honor, of course it hurts to know, and to know that these are the people who gave us birth and raised us... so to speak. my mother thought it was swell to be around these criminals associated with gangsters (read the Time and Newsweek articles). There is no question that the engineers of munitions disasters do not know how to run a marriage, or how to treat their children. How about some population control, Lord knows the world could use a lot of that. Why not begin with a program of forbidding criminals from having children?
