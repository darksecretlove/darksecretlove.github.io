But wait! There's more! Her son, David, inherited me as friend and tenant. David is Lotties son, I see her in him, he carries on the legacy. I still have affordable studio space. What glorious bounty! Thank you David.

For now I would like to end my musings in this space about Lottie on a much more personal note than the above. I heartily reiterate my invitation to any and all who find yourselves here, those of you who knew her: please feel more than free to add to this hopefully one day collective memory of Lottie Rose!...Again, on a more personal note...at her memorial many were wearing the necklaces that I had made, that she had bought from me in her last year of life. She gave me the gift of support that all artists need, and it was so that she could also leave tangible gifts for so many who knew her. This was typical of Lottie, always. Also typical---so many spoke of it at the memorial, because it meant so much to us, comming from her---she called me 'Angel', always, unless she was calling me 'Puti'(little naked baby angels in Renaisance paintings), or 'Darling'. Once she called me her little 'Fink', or so I thought she said. When I questioned her, she explained that it is a tiny bird, and then I realized that she meant 'Finche', as we call it in English, perhaps spelled the same or similarly in German.

I guess, not really knowing why I put quotation marks around my last question to David Rose, that I must have been quoting my own inner mind. I am also not quite sure whether Lottie's little town was in Bavaria, it's another thing I always thought about her, perhaps not exactly remembering what she had told me. Perhaps she had never said the name of the town, and my imagination had filled in the gap. No matter, toward the end of her life she talked about the town more and more in Bacheso's (another mis-spelling from above!- I wish there was spell-check and editing ability after the fact, here at 'Gallery'). In that last year she painted more vivid pictures of her early life than at any time I could remember since I had known her. Perhaps here is not the place to go into the details of what I know of Lottie's childhood. Perhaps it is all in the journals which I fervently hope were not destroyed, perhaps her son has them and perhaps he will write the book of Lottie one day. I am willing to say this much: to have been a child in that family, in that village, in that nation, in those times, it is nothing short of a miracle that Lottie was able to do so much more than merely rise up above the worst that humankind had shown itself to be capable of. She loved her mother, or at least she had utmost sympathy for her. Her mother must have been worthy of her love, perhaps it is a small clue to the mystery of Lottie and her lifelong ability to fly so high above the riff-raff, in spite of the extreme difficulty of her childhood. And lottie set an example for the world, that to rise above the most difficult childhood circumstances need not be a miracle. While the childhoods of petty criminals and faschist tyrants alike are rife with sordid details of hideous neglect and abuse, it goes without saying that it often happens that the best among us are not slaves to that kind of past, that we all must find a way to the Lottie within us, more properly, our own true selves. After all, our children, all living creatures, our world is at stake.

I am not exactly certain how significant it is that on that first meeting of Lottie at my show and slide talk, I had been speaking at length of the Holocaust, and it's effect on my life and work. I do know this: as I listened to her generous praise of my artwork, in her thick and beautiful German accent, I began to imagine that her being so immediately moved by my work,had something to do with her being German, my being Jewish. Only in the last year of her life did I begin to question my own thoughts on this, for reasons that are obscure, even to me. It is possible that at that first encounter, I siezed on something that only seemed obvious; that very obviousness really only based on my desire (that in the post-Holocaust world Jewish people, German people, and people in general the world over, would be deeply reflective of what that experience of the world was, what that realization might mean to the world, to individuals). My hope was that since that time the subject would be explored and expounded upon by most people in the world, in part to develope awareness, humanity and compassion, and therefore in even larger part to prevent another such occurance. I have never lost sight of that hope within , even though the world has shown by various means again and again that conciousness is not it's way. In Lottie's last year, somewhere along the way I began to realize that Lottie, who had married a Jewish man, who's son is half- Jewish, who was friend to all, was and had always been a mystery to me. She was a person of compassion. She was a person of huge ideas and ideals, a practical person deeply in touch with the physical and material world, ready at a moment's notice to fix what she could in what was broken in humanity around her. I knew some facts of Lottie's life; that she was born in a tiny Bavarian village, was born into a world not of her making, during the rise of nazism. Imagine one with a heart and courage such as hers contending as a child, one who is just forming, with a Germany, a European megolithic monster of fascism, such as the &quot;civilized&quot; world had never seen. I cannot imagine what that would be like. So in the 80s, before I met Lottie, as was my habit while making art, I listened to Donahue on the television, as I painted. On it were a contingincy of young German people who were assiduously paying deep attention to the psychological legacy of Nazism. These were young people (my age at the time) rightfully traumatized at the realization of what had occured, beyond their own control, not there fault, yet something monolithic to be looked at. I sobbed as I painted, while the young people on T.V. sobbed. When I met Lottie, I was as immediately aware of her humanity, as she was of mine. Mutual feeling was happening, this was my experience of Lottie, always. Often between us was that feeling, very little said by either of us by way of exposition. Much was perhaps taken for granted by both of us, based on each of our own inner worlds, in the presence of one another. Perhaps that is why it all worked out, even when I began to pour out to Lottie and to the world my own personal and traumatic origins, what I know was most difficult for Lottie to hear, that which for her would have been most difficult to tell, to put into words. She let me talk, she read my tell-all book, she came to my tell-all exhibition, Insomnia (Awakening) at Pro Arts, in Oakland. And still Lottie remained my friend, she who was such an enigma. I wonder, she told some, alluded to other things, she was never able to get comfortable with just finding a way to bring it all out. Perhaps she was a Rorschac blot, willing to accommodate the imaginings of all around her. Perhaps this was the magic of Lottie, who I always thought of as my Fairy Godmother. In the end, she even granted me a home for my homeless artwork. Looking at her face over the years, I often saw her as Jewish. At the memorial, looking at her photos in her younger day, especially one in a kerchief with dark curls escaping from under it, my heart opened further still at an imagining that felt real: Lottie was a secret Jew. I begged her several times toward the end to leave her thirty years of journals to her son, not to destroy them as she said she wanted to do. I hope she did. Maybe some day I will have the courage to ask David, &quot;Did Lottie leave you her journals?&quot;

Yesterday was the memorial, at Sweets Ballroom, downtown Oakland. Somewhere between three and five-hundred people attended. Of the people who spoke publicly, and the ones I spoke more privately with, what a wide and diverse group of individuals who all talked about Lottie's generosity, both of her spirit and materially! About her spirit, all were in agreement one way and another, that Lottie was no goody-two-shoes Pollyanna. No, it is important to say she was honest, spoke her mind, did what she believed best, was fiesty, even sometimes tactless, a consequence sometimes in one who speaks her mind. When I heard sometimes outrageous  pronouncements from Lottie I would laugh, because she had an outrageous sense of humor, really the only kind of person I can abide by. I, in turn was always allowed every freedom to express myself, she never shut me up in any way, even when she was not comfortable with the subject, we both spoke our minds where it was most important for us; therefore there was never a conflict. I believe, based on statements made by her sometimes years after a conversation, that things I said actually got through to her, that she sometimes thought about things that had been difficult, and was perhaps somewhat convinced, not as important to me as the listening part, but an important sign of the marvelous wealth of real intellect and diversity of thought in Lottie. At her memorial a gentleman of classical music, John, a man of perceptive reflection, a former tennant of hers, replied when I told him of the vast collection of my artwork Lottie had made, &quot;Well, please don't think for one moment she did it out of generosity, she was an art collector of exquisite taste!&quot; As an artist in a sometimes unwelcomming world such as ours toward people like me, it was the kind of statement in answer to an ongoing internal dilemma I always want to hear. Nevertheless, I do not believe it to be an either/or question. Later, talking to Slobodan Dan Paich, of Atrship, I believe we hit on something closer to an answer when we both spoke of Lottie in the glowing terms (and faces) of those who feel ultimately understood. For Lottie, the artist is the art and the art is the artist, Hence the generosity of friendship hand in hand with the material generosity that most certainly was Lottie Rose. I spoke during the Memorial. I opened up my truly short eulogy with the statement, &quot;Mother Theresa  said that the problem in this world is that too many people draw their family circle too small.&quot; I looked around the room of three to five-hundred people, and I said, &quot;well, Lottie's family circle was quite, quite large.&quot;
