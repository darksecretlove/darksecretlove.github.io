Many have died horrible deaths in the attempt, throughout the ages. If women did not now have legal recourse to abortion in this country, women would still find ways, and many women would die.There are many reasons for a girl or a woman to choose to end an unwanted pregnancy. It is HER choice, her legal choice, her health and well-being are of ultimate importance at a time that is never an easy time for any woman or girl. 'Right to life' means to me that an infant, a baby, a child is brought into this world wanted and loved, cherished above all else, with absolute willingness to serve the infant, absolute unwillingness to harm the child in any way. Abortion as birth control needs to be discouraged by close, careful attention and care for all women and girls, for all boys. this must happen in the home, schools, and in doctor's offices. We must as a society put special emphasis on educating girls and boys about birth control, rape, insest, as well as the multiple other reasons why motherhood is not necessarily the path for all women. We must both fund daycare for all working parents, and we must educate all would be parents how to bring children lovingly and kindly through this world. There must be an unwillingness on the parts of parents and care-givers to do harm, including the harm ultimately done to all of society, when anyone harms a child. I believe with my whole heart that we would do away with all crime, all war, if unwanted and uncared for children were not brought into this world to suffer. Finally, in a world that is increasingly and exponentially harmed by climate chaos due to global warming, it is of monumental importance that people weigh heavily all the consequences of their descisions. Each new one born adds exponentially to the facts of environmental catastrophe; the needs of the new ones must to be considered. Questions to ask are: is it considerate, is it kind, or is it perhaps cruel to bring new ones into this mess? My hope is that at long last reason and rationality will prevail in the minds of all considering these questions and a woman's right to choose.

For an excellent history of the destruction of human life that is back-alley abortion, I recommend: Histoire D'un Secret, or History of a secret. It is also a beautiful bio-pic of the French artist Clotilde Vautier.

Hi Chandra,  I am having mixed emotions after seeing your film of the studio.  It was so beautiful, like a palace filled with your art and the energy of creativity of both you and your art students.  One of them being me! I have such good memories of the studio and sometimes long for that time; what a place!  Much gratitude always for your art instruction.  Best, Nina
